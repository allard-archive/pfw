This is pfw, a web based front end for OpenBSD's packet filter (pf) written in
PHP.

The goal of pfw is to be as simple and effective as pf is. With the release of
version 0.6, pfw has all the functionality needed for everyday use in production
environments. There are a few minor limitations listed below. If any of them
seem vital to you, pfw is probably not for you.


What's not working, and probably never will is:
- timeout settings on a an individual rule basis. Adding this will
  increase the complexity of the rulebase quite substantailly.
- source-hash keys, pf makes perfectly good strong keys by itself.
- set require-order, pfw will make order out of chaos. It will
  not be possible to have disorder in the ruleset when using pfw.

About negated rules:
  Pfw will reformat negated rules as follows:
    ! { foo, bar } will be reformated to { !foo, !bar }
  This was simply for interface reasons. If someone can show a simple way
  of displaying the various rule negation possibilities in a better
  way, I'll gladly implement them. So far, I've found this to be the 
  best middle ground.

For instructions on how to install pfw, please read INSTALL.
