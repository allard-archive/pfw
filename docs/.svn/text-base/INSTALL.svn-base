To install pfw, follow these simple steps.

1) Make sure you have PHP version 5.0 or later installed (php -v reveals
the version number).

2) Make sure you have sqlite and the PHP sqlite module installed
('php -i | grep SQLite' will tell). 

3) Unpack the pfw archive somewhere reachable by your webserver. In this
document, I will assume that you have installed pfw in
/var/www/pfw and it doesn't matter where you installed it. As long as you
change everything accordingly.

4) Install the sqlite database and then:
cd /var/www/pfw && sqlite conf/config.db < docs/sql/sqlite.sql

5) Make sure that the web server has write access to the conf
directory: cd /var/www/pfw && chown -R www:www conf

6) Add the following to your /var/www/conf/httpd.conf
Alias /pfw "/var/www/pfw/web/"
<Directory "/var/www/pfw/web">
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from 127.0.0.1
</Directory>

This will allow you to access pfw from 127.0.0.1 only (or tunneled through
ssh). Please change this to suit your needs. There is currently no builtin 
authentication in pfw so please read http://httpd.apache.org/docs/howto/auth.html 
and add authentication accordingly.

7) pfw needs Apache to run in non-chrooted mode (otherwise, we can't
access /etc/pf.conf) so add httpd_flags="-u" to your /etc/rc.conf.local
and start apache by issuing 'httpd -u'. In almost all cases, you will
want to add SSL to your apache config as well. Please read ssl(8) and
then add httpd_flags="-u -DSSL" and start apache by issuing 'httpd -u
-DSSL'.

8) pfw relies on sudo to perform privileged operations and sudo needs to
be configured for this. You need to add a line like this: 
www ALL = NOPASSWD: /var/www/pfw/bin/*
to your /etc/sudoers file (edit with visudo and replace /var/www/pfw 
with the directory where you installed pfw). Feel free to verify the scripts 
in the bin directory to see that they don't do anything nasty before 
doing this :-)


That's it. Pfw is now installed and ready to be used.

Enjoy!
